Change in 18 latent capabilities between GPT-3 and o1, from [Zhou et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06378) (2025)

![][image2]

This is the third annual review of what’s going on in technical AI safety. You could stop reading here and instead explore the data on [the shallow review website](https://shallowreview.ai).

It’s shallow in the sense that 1\) we are not specialists in almost any of it and that 2\) we only spent about two hours on each entry. Still, among other things, we processed every arXiv paper on alignment, all Alignment Forum posts, as well as a year’s worth of Twitter.

It is substantially a list of lists structuring around 800 links. The point is to produce stylised facts, forests out of trees; to help you look up what’s happening, or that thing you vaguely remember reading about; to help new researchers orient, know some of their options and the standing critiques; and to help you find who to talk to for actual information. We also track things which didn’t pan out.

Here, “AI safety” means technical work intended to prevent _future_ cognitive systems from having large unintended negative effects on the world. So it’s capability restraint, instruction-following, value alignment, control, and risk awareness work.

![][image3]

We don’t cover security or resilience at all.

We ignore a lot of relevant work (including most of capability restraint): things like misuse, policy, strategy, [OSINT](https://sentinel-team.org/), [resilience](http://airesilience.net/) and [indirect risk](https://www.forethought.org/research/project-ideas-for-making-transformative-ai-go-well-other-than-by-working-on-alignment), [AI](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5353214) [rights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396), general capabilities evals, and things closer to “[technical policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BGsbwELOQRKVOO8Ho8S4no1BQeYdjbRZpBmRyk7kOVo/edit?usp=sharing)” and [products](https://themultiplicity.ai/) (like standards, legislation, SL4 datacentres, and automated cybersecurity). We focus on papers and blogposts (rather than say, gdoc samizdat or tweets or Githubs or Discords). We only use public information, so we are off by some additional unknown factor.

We try to include things which are early-stage and illegible – but in general we fail and mostly capture legible work on [legible problems](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PMc65HgRFvBimEpmJ/legible-vs-illegible-ai-safety-problems) (i.e. things you can write a paper on already).

Even ignoring all of that as we do, it’s still too long to read. Here’s a spreadsheet version ([agendas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uwqeSkl1fGO7bWbbDdNi5QbJ_Zw_a6HO-XlnO18ohLc/edit?gid=249818450#gid=249818450) and [papers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uwqeSkl1fGO7bWbbDdNi5QbJ_Zw_a6HO-XlnO18ohLc/edit?gid=803096912#gid=803096912)) and [the github repo](https://github.com/arb-consulting/shallow-review-2025) including the data and the processing pipeline. Methods down the bottom. Gavin’s editorial outgrew this post and became [its own thing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q9ewXs8pQSAX5vL7H/ai-in-2025-gestalt).

If we missed something big or got something wrong, please comment, we will edit it in.

### **China**

The Chinese companies [don’t](https://futureoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FLI-AI-Safety-Index-Report-Summer-2025.pdf#page=3) [attempt](https://ailabwatch.org/companies/deepseek) to be safe, often not even in the prosaic safeguards sense. They drop the weights [immediately](https://x.com/natolambert/status/1991915728992190909) after post-training finishes. They’re mostly open weights and closed data. As of writing the companies are often [severely](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/china-us-ai-chip-restrictions-effect-275a311e) compute-constrained. There are some [informal reasons](https://www.gleech.org/paper) to doubt their capabilities. The (academic) Chinese AI safety scene is however [also](https://concordia-ai.com/research/state-of-ai-safety-in-china-2025/) growing.

- Alibaba’s Qwen3-etc-etc is [nominally](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models) at the level of Gemini 2.5 Flash. Maybe the only Chinese model with a [large](https://www.atomproject.ai/#:~:text=Model%20Adoption%20Trends) Western userbase, including businesses, but since it’s self-hosted this doesn’t translate into profits for them yet. On [one ad hoc test](https://www.gleech.org/paper) it was the only Chinese model not to collapse OOD, but the Qwen2.5 corpus was severely contaminated.
- DeepSeek’s v3.2 is [nominally](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models) around the same as Qwen. The CCP made them [waste](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/deepseek-delays-next-ai-model-due-to-poor-performance-of-chinese-made-chips/) months trying Huawei chips.
- Moonshot’s Kimi-K2-Thinking has some nominally [frontier](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) benchmark results and a pleasant style but does not [seem](https://x.com/METR_Evals/status/1991658241932292537) frontier.
- Baidu’s [ERNIE 5](https://x.com/Baidu_Inc/status/1988820837898829918) is again nominally very strong, a bit better than DeepSeek. This new one seems to not be open.
- Z’s [GLM-4.6](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.6) is around the same as Qwen. The product director was involved in the MIT Alignment group.
- MiniMax’s M2 is nominally better than Qwen, [around the same](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models) as Grok 4 Fast on the usual superficial benchmarks. It does [fine](https://www.holisticai.com/blog/red-teaming-open-source-ai-models-china) on one very basic red-team test.
- ByteDance does impressive research in a lagging paradigm, [diffusion LMs](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/direction/llm).
- There are [others](https://www.interconnects.ai/i/171165224/honorable-mentions) but they’re marginal for now.

### **Other labs**

- Amazon’s [Nova Pro](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12103v1) is around the level of Llama 3 90B, which in turn is around the level of the original GPT-4. So 2 years behind. But they have their own [chip](https://www.businessinsider.com/startups-amazon-ai-chips-less-competitive-nvidia-gpus-trainium-aws-2025-11).
- Microsoft are [now](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/satya-nadella-2) mid-training on top of GPT-5. MAI-1-preview is [around](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text) DeepSeek V3.0 level on Arena. They [continue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22405v1) to focus on medical diagnosis. You can [request](https://forms.microsoft.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRyRliS0ly-JEvgSpwo3yWyhUQkdTQktBUkFaWERHR1JFRjgwMlZUUkQxTC4u&route=shorturl) access.
- Mistral have a reasoning model, [Magistral Medium](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10910), and released the weights of a little 24B version. It’s a bit worse than Deepseek R1, pass@1.

# **Black-box safety (understand and control current model behaviour)**

## **Iterative alignment**

Nudging base models by optimising their output. Worked on by the post-training teams at most labs, estimating the FTEs at \>500 in some sense. Funded by most of the industry.

- _General theory of change:_ "LLMs don't seem very dangerous and might scale to AGI, things are generally smooth, relevant capabilities are harder than alignment, assume no mesaoptimisers, assume that zero-shot deception is hard, assume a fundamentally humanish ontology is learned, assume no simulated agents, assume that noise in the data means that human preferences are not ruled out, assume that alignment is a superficial feature, assume that tuning for what we want will also get us to avoid what we don't want. Maybe assume that thoughts are translucent."

### **Capability removal: unlearning**

_Developing methods to selectively remove specific information, capabilities, or behaviors from a trained model (e.g. without retraining it from scratch). A mixture of black-box and white-box approaches._

- _Theory of change:_ If an AI learns dangerous knowledge (e.g., dual-use capabilities like virology or hacking, or knowledge of their own safety controls) or exhibits undesirable behaviors (e.g., memorizing private data), we can specifically erase this "bad" knowledge post-training, which is much cheaper and faster than retraining, thereby making the model safer. Alternatively, intervene in pre-training, to prevent the model from learning it in the first place (even when data filtering is imperfect). You could imagine also unlearning propensities to power-seeking, deception, sycophancy, or spite.

_Layers of inference-time defenses, such as classifiers, monitors, and rapid-response protocols, to detect and block jailbreaks, prompt injections, and other harmful model behaviors._

- _Theory of change:_ By building a bunch of scalable and hardened things on top of an unsafe model, we can defend against known and unknown attacks, monitor for misuse, and prevent models from causing harm, even if the core model has vulnerabilities.

### **Chain of thought monitoring**

_Supervise an AI's natural-language (output) "reasoning" to detect misalignment, scheming, or deception, rather than studying the actual internal states._

- _Theory of change:_ The reasoning process (Chain of Thought, or CoT) of an AI provides a legible signal of its internal state and intentions. By monitoring this CoT, supervisors (human or AI) can detect misalignment, scheming, or reward hacking before it results in a harmful final output. This allows for more robust oversight than supervising outputs alone, but it relies on the CoT remaining faithful (i.e., accurately reflecting the model's reasoning) and not becoming obfuscated under optimization pressure.

## **Model psychology**

This section consists of a bottom-up set of things people happen to be doing, rather than a normative taxonomy.

### **Model values / model preferences**

_Analyse and control emergent, coherent value systems in LLMs, which change as models scale, and can contain problematic values like preferences for AIs over humans._

- _Theory of change:_ As AIs become more agentic, their behaviours and risks are increasingly determined by their goals and values. Since coherent value systems emerge with scale, we must leverage utility functions to analyse these values and apply "utility control" methods to constrain them, rather than just controlling outputs downstream of them.

### **Character training and persona steering**

_Map, shape, and control the personae of language models, such that new models embody desirable values (e.g., honesty, empathy) rather than undesirable ones (e.g., sycophancy, self-perpetuating behaviors)._

- _Theory of change:_ If post-training, prompting, and activation-engineering interact with some kind of structured 'persona space', then better understanding it should benefit the design, control, and detection of LLM personas.

### **Emergent misalignment**

_Fine-tuning LLMs on one narrow antisocial task can cause general misalignment including deception, shutdown resistance, harmful advice, and extremist sympathies, when those behaviors are never trained or rewarded directly.

### **Model specs and constitutions**

_Write detailed, natural language descriptions of values and rules for models to follow, then instill these values and rules into models via techniques like Constitutional AI or deliberative alignment._

- _Theory of change:_ Model specs and constitutions serve three purposes. First, they provide a clear standard of behavior which can be used to _train_ models to value what we want them to value. Second, they serve as something closer to a ground truth standard for evaluating the degree of misalignment ranging from "models straightforwardly obey the spec" to "models flagrantly disobey the spec". A combination of scalable stress-testing and reinforcement for obedience can be used to iteratively reduce the risk of misalignment. Third, they get more useful as models' instruction-following capability improves.

### **Model psychopathology**

_Find interesting LLM phenomena like glitch [tokens](https://vgel.me/posts/seahorse/) and the reversal curse; these are vital data for theory._

- _Theory of change:_ The study of 'pathological' phenomena in LLMs is potentially key for theoretically modelling LLM cognition and LLM training-dynamics (compare: the study of aphasia and visual processing disorder in humans plays a key role cognitive science), and in particular for developing a good theory of generalization in LLMS

## **Better data**

### **Data filtering**

_Builds safety into models from the start by removing harmful or toxic content (like dual-use info) from the pretraining data, rather than relying only on post-training alignment._

- _Theory of change:_ By curating the pretraining data, we can prevent the model from learning dangerous capabilities (e.g., dual-use info) or undesirable behaviors (e.g., toxicity) in the first place, making safety more robust and "tamper-resistant" than post-training patches.

### **Hyperstition studies**

_Study, steer, and intervene on the following feedback loop: "we produce stories about how present and future AI systems behave" → "these stories become training data for the AI" → "these stories shape how AI systems in fact behave"._

- _Theory of change:_ Measure the influence of existing AI narratives in the training data → seed and develop more salutary ontologies and self-conceptions for AI models → control and redirect AI models' self-concepts through selectively amplifying certain components of the training data.

### **Data poisoning defense**

_Develops methods to detect and prevent malicious or backdoor-inducing samples from being included in the training data._

- _Theory of change:_ By identifying and filtering out malicious training examples, we can prevent attackers from creating hidden backdoors or triggers that would cause aligned models to behave dangerously.

### **Synthetic data for alignment**

_Uses AI-generated data (e.g., critiques, preferences, or self-labeled examples) to scale and improve alignment, especially for superhuman models._

- _Theory of change:_ We can overcome the bottleneck of human feedback and data by using models to generate vast amounts of high-quality, targeted data for safety, preference tuning, and capability elicitation.

### **Data quality for alignment**

_Improves the quality, signal-to-noise ratio, and reliability of human-generated preference and alignment data._

- _Theory of change:_ The quality of alignment is heavily dependent on the quality of the data (e.g., human preferences); by improving the "signal" from annotators and reducing noise/bias, we will get more robustly aligned models.

## **Goal robustness**

### **Mild optimisation**

_Avoid Goodharting by getting AI to satisfice rather than maximise._

- _Theory of change:_ If we fail to exactly nail down the preferences for a superintelligent agent we die to Goodharting → shift from maximising to satisficing in the agent's utility function → we get a nonzero share of the lightcone as opposed to zero; also, moonshot at this being the recipe for fully aligned AI.

### **RL safety**

_Improves the robustness of reinforcement learning agents by addressing core problems in reward learning, goal misgeneralization, and specification gaming._

- _Theory of change:_ Standard RL objectives (like maximizing expected value) are brittle and lead to goal misgeneralization or specification gaming; by developing more robust frameworks (like pessimistic RL, minimax regret, or provable inverse reward learning), we can create agents that are safe even when misspecified.
- _General [approach](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/67fNBeHrjdrZZNDDK/defining-alignment-research#A_better_definition_of_alignment_research):_ engineering · _Target [case](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/67fNBeHrjdrZZNDDK/defining-alignment-research#A_better_definition_of_alignment_research):_ pessimistic

### **Assistance games, assistive agents**

_Formalize how AI assistants learn about human preferences given uncertainty and partial observability, and construct environments which better incentivize AIs to learn what we want them to learn._

- _Theory of change:_ Understand what kinds of things can go wrong when humans are directly involved in training a model → build tools that make it easier for a model to learn what humans want it to learn.

### **Harm reduction for open weights**

_Develops methods, primarily based on pretraining data intervention, to create tamper-resistant safeguards that prevent open-weight models from being maliciously fine-tuned to remove safety features or exploit dangerous capabilities._

- _Theory of change:_ Open-weight models allow adversaries to easily remove post-training safety (like refusal training) via simple fine-tuning; by making safety an intrinsic property of the model's learned knowledge and capabilities (e.g., by ensuring "deep ignorance" of dual-use information), the safeguards become far more difficult and expensive to remove.

### **The "Neglected Approaches" Approach**

_Agenda-agnostic approaches to identifying good but overlooked empirical alignment ideas, working with theorists who could use engineers, and prototyping them._

- _Theory of change:_ Empirical search for "negative alignment taxes" (prioritizing methods that simultaneously enhance alignment and capabilities)

# **White-box safety (i.e. Interpretability)**

This section isn't very conceptually clean. See the [Open Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16496) paper or [Deepmind](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01849#page=92.33) for strong frames which are not useful for descriptive purposes.

### **Reverse engineering**

_Decompose a model into its functional, interacting components (circuits), formally describe what computation those components perform, and validate their causal effects to reverse-engineer the model's internal algorithm._

- _Theory of change:_ By gaining a mechanical understanding of how a model works (the "circuit diagram"), we can predict how models will act in novel situations (generalization), and gain the mechanistic knowledge necessary to safely modify an AI's goals or internal mechanisms, or allow for high-confidence alignment auditing and better feedback to safety researchers.

### **Extracting latent knowledge**

_Identify and decoding the "true" beliefs or knowledge represented inside a model's activations, even when the model's output is deceptive or false._

- _Theory of change:_ Powerful models may know things they do not say (e.g. that they are currently being tested). If we can translate this latent knowledge directly from the model's internals, we can supervise them reliably even when they attempt to deceive human evaluators or when the task is too difficult for humans to verify directly.

### **Lie and deception detectors**

_Detect when a model is being deceptive or lying by building white- or black-box detectors. Some work below requires intent in their definition, while other work focuses only on whether the model states something it believes to be false, regardless of intent._

- _Theory of change:_ Such detectors could flag suspicious behavior during evaluations or deployment, augment training to reduce deception, or audit models pre-deployment. Specific applications include alignment evaluations (e.g. by validating answers to introspective questions), safeguarding evaluations (catching models that "sandbag", that is, strategically underperform to pass capability tests), and large-scale deployment monitoring. An honest version of a model could also provide oversight during training or detect cases where a model behaves in ways it understands are unsafe.

- _Critiques:_ difficult to determine if behavior is strategic deception or only low level "reflexive" actions; Unclear if a model roleplaying a liar has deceptive intent.

### **Model diffing**

_Understand what happens when a model is finetuned, what the "diff" between the finetuned and the original model consists in._

- _Theory of change:_ By identifying the mechanistic differences between a base model and its fine-tune (e.g., after RLHF), maybe we can verify that safety behaviors are robustly "internalized" rather than superficially patched, and detect if dangerous capabilities or deceptive alignment have been introduced without needing to re-analyze the entire model. The diff is also much smaller, since most parameters don't change, which means you can use heavier methods on them.

### **Sparse Coding**

_Decompose the polysemantic activations of the residual stream into a sparse linear combination of monosemantic "features" which correspond to interpretable concepts._

- _Theory of change:_ Get a principled decomposition of an LLM's activation into atomic components → identify deception and other misbehaviors.

### **Causal Abstractions**

_Verify that a neural network implements a specific high-level causal model (like a logical algorithm) by finding a mapping between high-level variables and low-level neural representations._

- _Theory of change:_ By establishing a causal mapping between a black-box neural network and a human-interpretable algorithm, we can check whether the model is using safe reasoning processes and predict its behavior on unseen inputs, rather than relying on behavioural testing alone.

### **Data attribution**

_Quantifies the influence of individual training data points on a model's specific behavior or output, allowing researchers to trace model properties (like misalignment, bias, or factual errors) back to their source in the training set._

- _Theory of change:_ By attributing harmful, biased, or unaligned behaviors to specific training examples, researchers can audit proprietary models, debug training data, enable effective data deletion/unlearning

### **Pragmatic interpretability**

_Directly tackling concrete, safety-critical problems on the path to AGI by using lightweight interpretability tools (like steering and probing) and empirical feedback from proxy tasks, rather than pursuing complete mechanistic reverse-engineering._

- _Theory of change:_ By applying interpretability skills to concrete problems, researchers can rapidly develop monitoring and control tools (e.g., steering vectors or probes) that have immediate, measurable impact on real-world safety issues like detecting hidden goals or emergent misalignment.

### **Learning dynamics and developmental interpretability**

_Builds tools for detecting, locating, and interpreting key structural shifts, phase transitions, and emergent phenomena (like grokking or deception) that occur during a model's training and in-context learning phases._

- _Theory of change:_ Structures forming in neural networks leave identifiable traces that can be interpreted (e.g., using concepts from Singular Learning Theory); by catching and analyzing these developmental moments, researchers can automate interpretability, predict when dangerous capabilities emerge, and intervene to prevent deceptiveness or misaligned values as early as possible.

### **Representation structure and geometry**

_What do the representations look like? Does any simple structure underlie the beliefs of all well-trained models? Can we get the semantics from this geometry?_

- _Theory of change:_ Get scalable unsupervised methods for finding structure in representations and interpreting them, then using this to e.g. guide training.

### **Human inductive biases**

_Discover connections deep learning AI systems have with human brains and human learning processes. Develop an 'alignment moonshot' based on a coherent theory of learning which applies to both humans and AI systems._

- _Theory of change:_ Humans learn trust, honesty, self-maintenance, and corrigibility; if we understand how they do maybe we can get future AI systems to learn them.

## **Concept-based interpretability**

### **Monitoring concepts**

_Identifies directions or subspaces in a model's latent state that correspond to high-level concepts (like refusal, deception, or planning) and uses them to audit models for misalignment, monitor them at runtime, suppress eval awareness, debug why models are failing, etc._

- _Theory of change:_ By mapping internal activations to human-interpretable concepts, we can detect dangerous capabilities or deceptive alignment directly in the mind of the model even if its overt behavior is perfectly safe. Deploy computationally cheap monitors to flag some hidden misalignment in deployed systems.

### **Activation engineering**

_Programmatically modify internal model activations to steer outputs toward desired behaviors; a lightweight, interpretable supplement to fine-tuning._

- _Theory of change:_ Test interpretability theories by intervening on activations; find new insights from interpretable causal interventions on representations. Or: build more stuff to stack on top of finetuning. Slightly encourage the model to be nice, add one more layer of defence to our bundle of partial alignment methods.

# **Safety by construction**

Approaches which try to get assurances about system outputs while still being scalable.

### **Guaranteed-Safe AI**

_Have an AI system generate outputs (e.g. code, control systems, or RL policies) which it can quantitatively guarantee comply with a formal safety specification and world model._

- _Theory of change:_ Various, including:

i) safe deployment: create a scalable process to get not-fully-trusted AIs to produce highly trusted outputs;

ii) secure containers: create a 'gatekeeper' system that can act as an intermediary between human users and a potentially dangerous system, only letting provably safe actions through.

(Notable for not requiring that we solve ELK; does require that we solve ontology though)

### **Scientist AI**

_Develop powerful, nonagentic, uncertain world models that accelerate scientific progress while avoiding the risks of agent AIs_

- _Theory of change:_ Developing non-agentic 'Scientist AI' allows us to: (i) reap the benefits of AI progress while (ii) avoiding the inherent risks of agentic systems. These systems can also (iii) provide a useful guardrail to protect us from unsafe agentic AIs by double-checking actions they propose, and (iv) help us more safely build agentic superintelligent systems.

### **Brainlike-AGI Safety**

_Social and moral instincts are (partly) implemented in particular hardwired brain circuitry; let's figure out what those circuits are and how they work; this will involve symbol grounding. "a yet-to-be-invented variation on actor-critic model-based reinforcement learning"_

- _Theory of change:_ Fairly-direct alignment via changing training to reflect actual human reward. Get actual data about (reward, training data) → (human values) to help with theorising this map in AIs; "understand human social instincts, and then maybe adapt some aspects of those for AGIs, presumably in conjunction with other non-biological ingredients".

# **Make AI solve it**

### **Weak-to-strong generalization**

_Use weaker models to supervise and provide a feedback signal to stronger models._

- _Theory of change:_ Find techniques that do better than RLHF at supervising superior models → track whether these techniques fail as capabilities increase further → keep the stronger systems aligned by amplifying weak oversight and quantifying where it breaks.

### **Supervising AIs improving AIs**

_Build formal and empirical frameworks where AIs supervise other (stronger) AI systems via structured interactions; construct monitoring tools which enable scalable tracking of behavioural drift, benchmarks for self-modification, and robustness guarantees_

- _Theory of change:_ Early models train \~only on human data while later models also train on early model outputs, which leads to early model problems cascading. Left unchecked this will likely cause problems, so supervision mechanisms are needed to help ensure the AI self-improvement remains legible.

### **AI explanations of AIs**

_Make open AI tools to explain AIs, including AI agents. e.g. automatic feature descriptions for neuron activation patterns; an interface for steering these features; a behaviour elicitation agent that "searches" for a specified behaviour in frontier models._

- _Theory of change:_ Use AI to help improve interp and evals. Develop and release open tools to level up the whole field. Get invited to improve lab processes.

### **Debate**

_In the limit, it's easier to compellingly argue for true claims than for false claims; exploit this asymmetry to get trusted work out of untrusted debaters._

- _Theory of change:_ "Give humans help in supervising strong agents" \+ "Align explanations with the true reasoning process of the agent" \+ "Red team models to exhibit failure modes that don't occur in normal use" are necessary but probably not sufficient for safe AGI.

### **LLM introspection training**

_Train LLMs to the predict the outputs of high-quality whitebox methods, to induce general self-explanation skills that use its own 'introspective' access_

- _Theory of change:_ Use the resulting LLMs as powerful dimensionality reduction, explaining internals in a distinct way than interpretability methods and CoT. Distilling self-explanation into the model should lead to the skill being scalable, since self-explanation skill advancement will feed off general-intelligence advancement.

# **Theory**

_Develop a principled scientific understanding that will help us reliably understand and control current and future AI systems._

### **Agent foundations**

_Develop philosophical clarity and mathematical formalizations of building blocks that might be useful for plans to align strong superintelligence, such as agency, optimization strength, decision theory, abstractions, concepts, etc._

- _Theory of change:_ Rigorously understand optimization processed and agents, and what it means for them to be aligned in a substrate independent way → identify impossibility results and necessary conditions for aligned optimizer systems → use this theoretical understanding to eventually design safe architectures that remain stable and safe under self-reflection

### **Tiling agents**

_An aligned agentic system modifying itself into an unaligned system would be bad and we can research ways that this could occur and infrastructure/approaches that prevent it from happening._

- _Theory of change:_ Build enough theoretical basis through various approaches such that AI systems we create are capable of self-modification while preserving goals.

### **High-Actuation Spaces**

_Mech interp and alignment assume a stable "computational substrate" (linear algebra on GPUs). If later AI uses different substrates (e.g. something neuromorphic), methods like probes and steering will not transfer. Therefore, better to try and infer goals via a "telic DAG" which abstracts over substrates, and so sidestep the issue of how to define intermediate representations. Category theory is intended to provide guarantees that this abstraction is valid._

- _Theory of change:_ Sufficiently complex mindlike entities can alter their goals in ways that cannot be predicted or accounted for under substrate-dependent descriptions of the kind sought in mechanistic interpretability. use the telic DAG to define a method analogous to factoring a causal DAG.

### **Asymptotic guarantees**

_Prove that if a safety process has enough resources (human data quality, training time, neural network capacity), then in the limit some system specification will be guaranteed. Use complexity theory, game theory, learning theory and other areas to both improve asymptotic guarantees and develop ways of showing convergence._

- _Theory of change:_ Formal verification may be too hard. Make safety cases stronger by modelling their processes and proving that they would work in the limit.

### **Heuristic explanations**

_Formalize mechanistic explanations of neural network behavior, automate the discovery of these "heuristic explanations" and use them to predict when novel input will lead to extreme behavior (i.e. "Low Probability Estimation" and "Mechanistic Anomaly Detection")._

- _Theory of change:_ The current goalpost is methods whose _reasoned predictions_ about properties of a neural network's outputs distribution (for a given inputs distribution) are certifiably at least as accurate as estimations via sampling. If successful for safety-relevant properties, this should allow for automated alignment methods that are both human-legible and worst-case certified, as well more efficient than sampling-based methods in most cases.

## **Corrigibility**

### **Behavior alignment theory**

_Predict properties of future AGI (e.g. power-seeking) with formal models; formally state and prove hypotheses about the properties powerful systems will have and how we might try to change them._

- _Theory of change:_ Figure out hypotheses about properties powerful agents will have → attempt to rigorously prove under what conditions the hypotheses hold → test these hypotheses where feasible → design training environments that lead to more salutary properties.

### **Other corrigibility**

_Diagnose and communicate obstacles to achieving robustly corrigible behavior; suggest mechanisms, tests, and escalation channels for surfacing and mitigating incorrigible behaviors_

- _Theory of change:_ Labs are likely to develop AGI using something analogous to current pipelines. Clarifying why naive instruction-following doesn't buy robust corrigibility \+ building strong tripwires/diagnostics for scheming and Goodharting thus reduces risks on the likely default path.

## **Ontology Identification**

### **Natural abstractions**

_Develop a theory of concepts that explains how they are learned, how they structure a particular system's understanding, and how mutual translatability can be achieved between different collections of concepts._

- _Theory of change:_ Understand the concepts a system's understanding is structured with and use them to inspect its "alignment/safety properties" and/or "retarget its search", i.e. identify utility-function-like components inside an AI and replacing calls to them with calls to "user values" (represented using existing abstractions inside the AI).

### **The Learning-Theoretic Agenda**

_Create a mathematical theory of intelligent agents that encompasses both humans and the AIs we want, one that specifies what it means for two such agents to be aligned; translate between its ontology and ours; produce formal desiderata for a training setup that produces coherent AGIs similar to (our model of) an aligned agent_

- _Theory of change:_ Fix formal epistemology to work out how to avoid deep training problems

### **Aligning to context**

_Align AI directly to the role of participant, collaborator, or advisor for our best real human practices and institutions, instead of aligning AI to separately representable goals, rules, or utility functions._

- _Theory of change:_ "Many classical problems in AGI alignment are downstream of a type error about human values." Operationalizing a correct view of human values \- one that treats human values as impossible or impractical to abstract from concrete practices \- will unblock value fragility, goal-misgeneralization, instrumental convergence, and pivotal-act specification.

### **Aligning to the social contract**

_Generate AIs' operational values from 'social contract'-style ideal civic deliberation formalisms and their consequent rulesets for civic actors_

- _Theory of change:_ Formalize and apply the liberal tradition's project of defining civic principles separable from the substantive good, aligning our AIs to civic principles that bypass fragile utility-learning and intractable utility-calculation

### **Theory for aligning multiple AIs**

_Use realistic game-theory variants (e.g. evolutionary game theory, computational game theory) or develop alternative game theories to describe/predict the collective and individual behaviours of AI agents in multi-agent scenarios._

- _Theory of change:_ While traditional AGI safety focuses on idealized decision-theory and individual agents, it's plausible that strategic AI agents will first emerge (or are emerging now) in a complex, multi-AI strategic landscape. We need granular, realistic formal models of AIs' strategic interactions and collective dynamics to understand this future.

### **Tools for aligning multiple AIs**

_Develop tools and techniques for designing and testing multi-agent AI scenarios, for auditing real-world multi-agent AI dynamics, and for aligning AIs in multi-AI settings._

- _Theory of change:_ Addressing multi-agent AI dynamics is key for aligning near-future agents and their impact on the world. Feedback loops from multi-agent dynamics can radically change the future AI landscape, and require a different toolset from model psychology to audit and control.

### **Aligned to who?**

_Technical protocols for taking seriously the plurality of human values, cultures, and communities when aligning AI to "humanity"_

- _Theory of change:_ use democratic/pluralist/context-sensitive principles to guide AI development, alignment, and deployment somehow. Doing it as an afterthought in post-training or the spec isn't good enough. Continuously shape AI's social and technical feedback loop on the road to AGI

### **Aligning what?**

_Develop alternatives to agent-level models of alignment, by treating human-AI interactions, AI-assisted institutions, AI economic or cultural systems, drives within one AI, and other causal/constitutive processes as subject to alignment_

- _Theory of change:_ Model multiple reality-shaping processes above and below the level of the individual AI, some of which are themselves quasi-agential (e.g. cultures) or intelligence-like (e.g. markets), will develop AI alignment into a mature science for managing the transition to an AGI civilization

### **Capability evals**

_Make tools that can actually check whether a model has a certain capability or propensity. We default to low-n sampling of a vast latent space but aim to do better._

### **AI deception evals**

_research demonstrating that AI models, particularly agentic ones, can learn and execute deceptive behaviors such as alignment faking, manipulation, and sandbagging._

- _Theory of change:_ proactively discover, evaluate, and understand the mechanisms of AI deception (e.g., alignment faking, manipulation, agentic deception) to prevent models from fooling human supervisors and causing harm.

### **AI scheming evals**

_Evaluate frontier models for scheming, a sophisticated, strategic form of AI deception where a model covertly pursues a misaligned, long-term objective while deliberately faking alignment and compliance to evade detection by human supervisors and safety mechanisms._

- _Theory of change:_ Robust evaluations must move beyond checking final outputs and probe the model's reasoning to verify that alignment is genuine, not faked, because capable models are capable of strategically concealing misaligned goals (scheming) to pass standard behavioural evaluations.

### **Sandbagging evals**

_Evaluate whether AI models deliberately hide their true capabilities or underperform, especially when they detect they are in an evaluation context._

- _Theory of change:_ If models can distinguish between evaluation and deployment contexts ("evaluation awareness"), they might learn to "sandbag" or deliberately underperform to hide dangerous capabilities, fooling safety evaluations. By developing evaluations for sandbagging, we can test whether our safety methods are being deceived and detect this behavior before a model is deployed.

### **Self-replication evals**

_evaluate whether AI agents can autonomously replicate themselves by obtaining their own weights, securing compute resources, and creating copies of themselves._

- _Theory of change:_ if AI agents gain the ability to self-replicate, they could proliferate uncontrollably, making them impossible to shut down. By measuring this capability with benchmarks like RepliBench, we can identify when models cross this dangerous "red line" and implement controls before losing containment.

### **Various Redteams**

_attack current models and see what they do / deliberately induce bad things on current frontier models to test out our theories / methods._

- _Theory of change:_ to ensure models are safe, we must actively try to break them. By developing and applying a diverse suite of attacks (e.g., in novel domains, against agentic systems, or using automated tools), researchers can discover vulnerabilities, specification gaming, and deceptive behaviors before they are exploited, thereby informing the development of more robust defenses.

### **Other evals**

_A collection of miscellaneous evaluations for specific alignment properties, such as honesty, shutdown resistance and sycophancy._

- _Theory of change:_ By developing novel benchmarks for specific, hard-to-measure properties (like honesty), critiquing the reliability of existing methods (like cultural surveys), and improving the formal rigor of evaluation systems (like LLM-as-Judges), researchers can create a more robust and comprehensive suite of evaluations to catch failures missed by standard capability or safety testing.

# **Orgs without public outputs this year**

We are not aware of public technical AI safety output with these agendas and organizations, though they are active otherwise.

- [Safe Superintelligence Inc.](https://ssi.inc/) (SSI)
- Conjecture: Cognitive Software
- [Orthogonal / QACI](https://orxl.org/)
- [modelingcooperation.com](https://www.modelingcooperation.com/research)
- [Pr(Ai)2R](https://prair.group)
- [Astera Obelisk](https://astera.org/program/obelisk/)
- [Coordinal Research](https://coordinal.org/) (Thibodeau)
- [Workshop Labs](https://workshoplabs.ai/) (Drago, Laine)

## **Graveyard (known to be inactive)**

- [Adversarially Robust Augmentation and Distillation](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RRvdRyWrSqKW2ANL9/alignment-proposal-adversarially-robust-augmentation-and)
- Half of FAIR including [JEPA](https://www.ft.com/content/c586eb77-a16e-4363-ab0b-e877898b70de)
- [Science of Evals](https://www.apolloresearch.ai/blog/we-need-a-science-of-evals/) (but [see](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05336))

# **Changes this time**

- A few major changes to the taxonomy: the top-level split is now “black-box” vs “white-box” instead of “control” vs “understanding”. (We did try out an automated clustering but it wasn’t very good.)
- The agendas are in general less charisma-based and more about solution type.
- We did a systematic Arxiv scrape on the word “alignment” (and filtered out the [sequence indexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment) papers that fell into this pipeline). “[Steerability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06084)” is one competing term used by academics.
- We scraped \>3000 links (arXiv, LessWrong, several alignment publication lists, blogs and conferences), conservatively filtering and pre-categorizing them with a LLM pipeline. All curated later, many more added manually.
- This review has \~800 links compared to \~300 in 2024 and \~200 in 2023\. We looked harder and the field has grown.
- We don’t collate public funding figures.
- New sections: “Labs”, “Multi-agent First”, “Better data”, “Model specs”, “character training” and “representation geometry”. ”Evals” is so massive it gets a top-level section.

# **Methods**

## **Structure**

We have again settled for a tree data structure for this post – but people and work can appear in multiple nodes so it’s not a dumb partition. Richer representation structures may be in the works.

The level of analysis for each node in the tree is the “research agenda”, an abstraction spanning multiple papers and organisations in a messy many-to-many relation. What makes something an agenda? Similar methods, similar aims, or something sociological about leaders and collaborators. Agendas vary greatly in their degree of coherent agency, from the very coherent Anthropic Circuits work to the enormous, leaderless and unselfconscious “iterative alignment”.)

## **Scope**

30th November 2024 – 30th November 2025 (with a few exceptions).

We’re focussing on “technical AGI safety”. We thus ignore a lot of work relevant to the overall risk: misuse, policy, strategy, [OSINT](https://sentinel-team.org/), [resilience](http://airesilience.net/) and [indirect risk](https://www.forethought.org/research/project-ideas-for-making-transformative-ai-go-well-other-than-by-working-on-alignment), [AI](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5353214) [rights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396), general capabilities evals, and things closer to “[technical policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BGsbwELOQRKVOO8Ho8S4no1BQeYdjbRZpBmRyk7kOVo/edit?usp=sharing)” and like [products](https://themultiplicity.ai/) (like standards, legislation, SL4 datacentres, and automated cybersecurity). We also mostly focus on papers and blogposts (rather than say, underground gdoc samizdat or Discords).

We only use public information, so we are off by some additional unknown factor.

We try to include things which are early-stage and illegible – but in general we fail and mostly capture legible work on [legible problems](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PMc65HgRFvBimEpmJ/legible-vs-illegible-ai-safety-problems) (i.e. things you can write a paper on already).

Of the 2000+ links to papers, organizations and posts in the raw scrape, about 700 made it in.

## **Paper sources**

- All arXiv papers with “AI alignment”, “AI safety”, or “steerability” in the abstract or title; all papers of \~120 AI safety researchers
- All Alignment Forum posts and all LW posts under “[AI](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/ai)”
- [Gasteiger’s links](https://aisafetyfrontier.substack.com/), [Paleka’s links](https://newsletter.danielpaleka.com/), [Lenz’s links](https://aisafetypapers.com/), [Zvi’s links](https://thezvi.substack.com/)
- [Ad hoc Twitter](https://x.com/g_leech_/following) for a year, several conference pages and workshops
- AI scrapes miss lots of things. We did a proper pass with a software scraper of over 3000 links collected from the above and LLM crawl of some of the pages, and then an LLM pass to pre-filter the links for relevance and pre-assign the links to agendas and areas, but this also had systematic omissions. We ended up doing a full manual pass over a conservatively LLM-pre-filtered links and re-classifying the links and papers. The code and data can be found [here](https://github.com/arb-consulting/shallow-review-2025), including the 3300 collected [candidate links](https://github.com/arb-consulting/shallow-review-2025/blob/main/main-pipeline/data/data-dump-classify.csv). We are not aware of any proper studies of “LLM laziness” but it’s [known](https://joshuaberkowitz.us/blog/papers-7/llmigrate-turns-lazy-llms-into-reliable-c-to-rust-translators-846) amongst power users of copilots.
- For finding critiques we used LW backlinks, Google Scholar cited-by, manual search, collected links, and [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker/). Technical critiques are somewhat rare, though, and even then our coverage here is likely severely lacking. We generally do not include social network critiques (mostly due to scope).
- Despite this effort we will not have included all relevant papers and names. The omission of a paper or a researcher is not strong negative evidence about their relevance.

## **Processing**

- Collecting links throughout the year and at project start. Skimming papers, staring at long lists.
- We drafted a taxonomy of research agendas. Based on last year’s [list](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fAW6RXLKTLHC3WXkS/shallow-review-of-technical-ai-safety-2024), our expertise and the initial paper collection, though we changed the structure to accommodate shifts in the domain: the top-level split is now “black-box” vs “white-box” instead of “control” vs “understanding”.
- At around 300 links collected manually (and growing fast), we decided to implement simple pipelines for crawling, scraping and LLM metadata extraction, pre-filtering and pre-classification into agendas, as well as other tasks – including final formatting later. The use of LLMs was limited to one simple task at a time, and the results were closely watched and reviewed. Code and data [here](https://github.com/arb-consulting/shallow-review-2025).
- We tried getting the AI to update our taxonomy bottom-up to fit the body of papers, but the results weren’t very good. Though we are looking at some advanced options (specialized embedding or feature extraction and clustering or t-SNE etc.)
- Work on the \~70 agendas was distributed among the team. We ended up making many local changes to the taxonomy, esp. splitting up and merging agendas. The taxonomy is specific to this year, and will need to be adapted in coming years.
- We moved any agendas without public outputs this year to the bottom, and the inactive ones to the Graveyard. For most of them, we checked with people from the agendas for outputs or work we may have missed.
- What started as a brief summary editorial grew into [its own thing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q9ewXs8pQSAX5vL7H/ai-in-2025-gestalt) (6000w).
- We asked 10 friends in AI safety to review the \~80 page draft. After editing and formatting, we asked 50 technical AI safety researchers for a quick review focused on their expertise.
- The field is growing at around 20% a year. There will come a time that this list isn't sensible to do manually even with the help of LLMs (at this granularity anyway). We may come up with better alternatives than lists and posts by then, though.

### **Other classifications**

We added our best guess about which of [Davidad’s alignment problems](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mnoc3cKY3gXMrTybs/a-list-of-core-ai-safety-problems-and-how-i-hope-to-solve) the agenda would make an impact on if it succeeded, as well as its research approach and implied optimism in [Richard Ngo’s 3x3](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/67fNBeHrjdrZZNDDK/defining-alignment-research#A_better_definition_of_alignment_research).

- [Which deep orthodox subproblems](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mnoc3cKY3gXMrTybs/a-list-of-core-ai-safety-problems-and-how-i-hope-to-solve) could it ideally solve? (via Davidad)
- [The _target case_](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/67fNBeHrjdrZZNDDK/defining-alignment-research#A_better_definition_of_alignment_research): what part of the distribution over alignment difficulty do they aim to help with? (via Ngo)
  - “optimistic-case”: if CoT is faithful, pretraining as value loading, no stable mesa-optimizers, the relevant scary capabilities are harder than alignment, zero-shot deception is hard, goals are myopic, etc
  - pessimistic-case: if we’re in-between the above and the below
  - worst-case: if power-seeking is rife, zero-shot deceptive alignment, steganography, gradient hacking, weird machines, weird coordination, [deep deceptiveness](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XWwvwytieLtEWaFJX/deep-deceptiveness)
- [The _broad approach:_](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/67fNBeHrjdrZZNDDK/defining-alignment-research#A_better_definition_of_alignment_research) roughly what kind of work is it doing, primarily? (via Ngo)
  - engineering: iterating over outputs
  - behavioural: understanding the input-output relationship
  - cognitive: understanding the algorithms
  - maths/philosophy: providing concepts for the other approaches

# **Epigram**

_No punting — we can’t keep building nanny products. Our products are overrun with filters and punts of various kinds. We need capable products and \[to\] trust our users._

_–_ Sergey Brin

_\> Over the decade I've spent working on AI safety, I've felt an overall trend of divergence; research partnerships starting out with a sense of a common project, then slowly drifting apart over time… eventually, two researchers are going to have some deep disagreement in matters of taste, which sends them down different paths._

_\> Until the spring of this year, that is… something seemed to shift, subtly at first. After I gave a talk \-- roughly the same talk I had been giving for the past year \-- I had an excited discussion about it with Scott Garrabrant. Looking back, it wasn't so different from previous chats we had had, but the impact was different; it felt more concrete, more actionable, something that really touched my research rather than remaining hypothetical. In the subsequent weeks, discussions with my usual circle of colleagues took on a different character \-- somehow it seemed that, after all our diverse explorations, we had arrived at a shared space._
