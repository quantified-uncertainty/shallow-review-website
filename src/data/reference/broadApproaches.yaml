approaches:
  - id: engineering
    name: Engineering
    description: Practical, implementation-focused approaches that build systems and tools to make AI safer. Emphasizes empirical testing, iterative development, and scalable solutions.

  - id: behavioral
    name: Behavioral
    description: Approaches focused on observable AI behavior and outputs rather than internal mechanisms. Includes techniques like RLHF, red-teaming, and behavioral testing.

  - id: cognitive
    name: Cognitive
    description: Approaches that model or analyze the internal reasoning, representations, and decision-making processes of AI systems. Includes interpretability and understanding how models "think."

  # - id: maths-philosophy
  #   name: Maths/Philosophy
  #   description: Theoretical and foundational approaches using mathematical formalization, logical analysis, and philosophical frameworks to understand and solve alignment problems.

  # - id: theoretical
  #   name: Theoretical
  #   description: Abstract, theory-driven research that develops formal frameworks and proofs about AI safety properties, often without immediate implementation.
